# VeloKeeper
  VeloKeeper is an Application built using React-Native. I built this app because everytime I had attended a Time-Trial event the time keeper would always use a physical book and a stopwatch, there would also sometimes be errors when calculating the scores based on one's prediction time and I hope this app can adress this.

## What it Does
  The purpose of this app is quite simple, it's used by someone known as a time keeper or referee, to keep track of the time each person in the time-trial sets. The app allows for the use of multiple entries using a decent looking UI (I think).
